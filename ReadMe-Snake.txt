//ReadMe for the game Snake

When starting a new game you will start as a single white block that will move when you 
select direction.

Once you chose a direction the game will start and you will continue moving untill you 
die.

Hitting a wall or your own body will resoult in a "death" and the game will automaticly 
restart after a delay.

Your objective is to gain points and to make your snake longer by eating the food that 
will randomly spawnaround the play area as red blocks.

To "eat" the food you must lead your snake head first into it.

As you gain points and length the game will get harder as you have to dodge more and more
of yourself.

Each food is worth 3 points and 3 new blocks of length on your snake.

The speed of the game will never change.

To control the direction your snake goes you can use W-up A-left S-down D-right, or the 
arrow keys.

You will be unable to move backwards in retrospect to your current direction
ex: Trying to move down when currecntly moving up is not allowed.
This is due to the rules of dieing when you hit yourself or walls
